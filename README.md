# Soft Tech V6 Report and Labeling Templates
This repository includes my self-designed report and labeling templates during my job in a window factory in Australia. I created these templates during my spare time to improve the efficiency of my daily work and streamline the production. They are free for personal use. Please <a href="mailto:yp_tan@outlook.com">contact me</a> for more information.
## Kidscreen Labels
Select all the window items which have "Kid Screen" from the quote (based on the screen report), print the item name, item quantities, kid screen frame size on each label.
